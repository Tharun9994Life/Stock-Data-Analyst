# Week 01 - [06/09/2025]

## What I Learned
- Using yfinance library
- Creating constructors and private methods in python

## What I Built
- A system that fetches stock data: Open, High, Low, Adjusted Close, Close prices and Volume
- To fetch data over a time period, the system will create a graph in matplotlib, showing the changes in Open Prices

## Challenges
- I had to learn exactly what kind of data I needed to work with when analysing stocks.

## Next Goals
- Implement a Simple Moving Average function
