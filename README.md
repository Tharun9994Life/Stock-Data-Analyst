# Stock-Data-Analyst
I'm a Year 13 student, attempting to analyse stock data. I will be learning more advanced python techniques, such as pandas, numpy, OOP and matplotlib.

Currently, I have used the yfinance library in python to fetch stock data, such as close prices or volumes. I have also created a function that can calculate the percentage returns gained from a stock.

Next week, I aim to implement a Simple Moving Average function that will highlight the trend of close prices.
